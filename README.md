### Simple userscript to quickly query the lists directly from the Query Log, Dashboard or Domains pages

Whenever something gets blocked and you want to know which list blocked it you have to manually copy the entry and go to Tools->Query Lists, when auditing multiple domains it becomes tiresome.

This user script allows doing this with just one click by adding icons (for both exact and partial search) directly to the tables which open the result in modal window. It is also possible to open the result in new tab by middle clicking the icon (or right click -> open in new tab).
